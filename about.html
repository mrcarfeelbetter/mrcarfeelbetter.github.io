				<p>Here at Mr. Car FeelBetter we make dreams come true, from the everyday ease of an Oil Change all the
					way to a complete Restoration of a Classic Ride.
					I started this business 15 years ago with a lifelong passion for
					fixing cars and a dream of owning my own repair shop.

					At Mr. Car FeelBetter, we believe that cars are more than just transportation.
					They are works of art that deserve to be kept in top condition. We love workin' with
					vintage cars, allowing them to come to life again lookin' like they just came off the factory line.

					We are committed to providing the highest quality service for our many clients.
					We offer a variety of services, from oil changes and tune-ups to engine repairs and body work.

					If you're looking for a reliable and honest repair shop for your car,
					look no further than Mr. Car FeelBetter. We look forward to working with you and helping to keep your

				<h2 class="script">Thousands of Projects <br> Even More Oil Changes!</h2>
				<p>
					Once upon a time, there was a man who loved two things in life: grunge music and cars.
					After years of playing in grunge bands and repairing cars in his spare time, he finally decided to
					combine
					his two passions and open his own car repair shop.

					This man, Mr. Car FeelBetter (Senior), is the owner of Mr. Car FeelBetter,
					a car repair shop specializing in vintage cars. For 15 years, he has been fixing cars and providing
					an essential service to his loyal customers.

					But it wasn't all work and no play for our grunge loving mechanic.
					In between oil changes and tire rotations, he would play his favorite grunge tunes
					and sing along at the top of his lungs. His favorite song? "Smells Like Teen Spirit" of course!

					The customers at the garage loved it. Some would even join in and sing
					along with him (when they could hear him over the high powered tools).
					On days when business was slow, he would also crank up his old record player and do a little
					old-fashioned air guitar.

					So if you're looking for a reliable car repair shop with a unique twist,
					head over to Mr. Car FeelBetter and let our man take care of all your car repair needs.
					And don't forget to bring your singing voice!</p>
